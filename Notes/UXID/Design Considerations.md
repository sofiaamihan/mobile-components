# Reminders
- Only override items that would come from a database - Components
- Read the entire paper incase there is an admin/user dynamic
-  If there are 10 entities, use 9 and use the last one for CRUD examples (BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE ALL USUALLY)
- Don't have to follow their wireframe layout to a T, as long as you have the proposed elements, they can be positioned anywhere you think is best
- Responsive sizing - set the behaviour of INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS, but make the parent element the one for auto layouts

# Dump
Issues:
- The wrong items are still clickable even if they have been scrolled behind the top nav
- Hard-coded svg instances
